# Machine Learning Project Proposal
1.	Project Type: Research-flavor project
2.	Problem addressed: This research has the potential to inform decision-making processes at various levels of the healthcare system, leading to improved resource allocation, policy development, and patient care outcomes.
3.	Project Goal and Motivation: The study aims to forecast future medication expenditure using data from the Medicaid by Drug dataset. This research seeks to provide insights into the expected costs of common medications for eligible patients requiring financial assistance.
4.	Methodology:
    a.	Data Preparation: Ensure the dataset is clean, organized, and ready for analysis. 
    b.	Feature Selection: Identify relevant features that could impact medication costs, such as drug characteristics, manufacturer information, and historical spending trends.
    c.	Model Selection: Select suitable machine learning algorithms for predicting medication costs. 
    d.	Training and Testing: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to train the model on historical data and evaluate its performance on new data.
    e.	Model Training: Train the chosen machine learning model using features like average spending per dosage unit and changes in spending over time to predict future medication costs.
    f.	Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics.
    g.	Prediction: Use modelâ€™s evaluation to make predictions on future medication costs based on new data for upcoming years.
5.	Datasets used: 
    a.  https://healthdata.gov/dataset/Medicaid-Spending-by-Drug/bzpg-gf5q/about_data
    b.	https://healthdata.gov/dataset/Drug-Products-in-the-Medicaid-Drug-Rebate-Program/rcra-yvyi/about_data
6.	Resources needed to carry out your project:
    a.	NumPy: For numerical computations and data manipulation.
    b.	Pandas: For data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis.
    c.	Scikit-learn (sklearn): For implementing machine learning models and performance evaluation.
    d.	PyTorch: If deep learning models are considered for prediction tasks.
